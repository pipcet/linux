Apple SMC on ARM SoCs
----------------------

All Apple ARM SoCs since A11 (including the M1) contain a coprocessor called
SMC. It has similar functionality but a different interface than the SMC on
Apple x86 systems.

The SMC provides hardware monitoring (temperature, voltage, battery) and some
control functions exposed as GPIOs (they are likely physically GPIOs on the
system PMIC, managed through SMC).

The driver requires the Apple IOP mailbox driver to function.

Required properties:

- compatible : shall be "apple,smc-m1" (for SMC on M1 SoC)
- reg : MMIO area used by the non-mailbox interface (ARM core control MMIO)
- mboxes : should be a reference to one mailbox, typically <32>, on an IOP
	   mailbox instance
- gpio-controller : should be present as the SMC provides up to 32 GPIOs
- #gpio-cells : should be <2>

Optional properties:

- gpio-%d : where %d is index of the GPIO, and the contents of the property
	    is a bit pattern applied when setting the GPIO; this marks the
	    GPIO as available to clients and allows it to be set

Example:

        smc: smc@23e050000 {
            compatible = "apple,smc-m1";
            reg = <0x2 0x3e050000 0x0 0x4000>;
            mboxes = <&smc_mbox 32>;

            gpio-controller;
            #gpio-cells = <2>;
            gpio-9 = <0x10000>;
            gpio-13 = <0x800000>;
            gpio-15 = <0>;
            gpio-20 = <0>;
        };

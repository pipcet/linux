Apple IOP mailbox handler
--------------------------

Apple SoCs contain numerous IOPs (I/O Processors) that talk to the cores
running Linux (AP) over a common mailbox protocol. Each IOP has its own
instance of the mailbox interface, which typically carries multiple endpoints,
and many IOPs also follow a common initialization scheme to discover and start
available endpoints. It also provides standard memory grant features for
mandatory endpoints 1-4 (crash log, syslog, debug, stats report).

This driver provides a Linux mailbox for each endpoint.

Required properties:

- compatible : shall be "apple,iop-mailbox-m1" (for IOPs on M1 SoC)
- reg : MMIO area used by the IOP mailbox interface
- interrupts : two interrupt specifiers, a AP-to-IOP mailbox empty notifier,
	       and a IOP-to-AP message available notiifer
- #mbox-cells : should be <1> as the parameter cell specifies endpoint index
- endpoints : should contain a list of cells enumerating endpoints to be
	      exposed as mailboxes; if endpoint <0> is present, the common
	      initialization scheme is not used and mailbox client for this
	      endpoint can take over startup; if any of endpoints <1 2 3 4>
	      is present, built-in support for these mandatory endpoints is
	      not provided

Optional properties:

- wait-init : bool; if true, the common initialization scheme will start only
	      when the first message is sent to any endpoint; this allows
	      a client to initialize some non-mailbox hardware the mailbox
	      depends on before talking to the mailbox
- clocks : clocks to be brought up before the mailbox interface is used

Example:

        smc_mbox: smc_mbox@23e408800 {
            compatible = "apple,iop-mailbox-m1";
            reg = <0x2 0x3e400000 0x0 0x20000>;
            interrupts = <0 400 4   0 403 4>;

            #mbox-cells = <1>;
            endpoints = <32>;
        };

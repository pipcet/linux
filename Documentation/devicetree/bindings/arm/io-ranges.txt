* MMIO type ranges in device tree

Some platforms require specific device access type for specific SoC buses.
For instance,  Apple ARM hardware requires different MMIO accesses in PCIe
and on-chip MMIO areas.  This device-tree binding allows specifying the
access type on a per-range basis.

The io-ranges node at / of device tree does not represent a real device,
but contains a list of MMIO address ranges, similar to reserved-memory.

Required properties:

- reg: the MMIO region of the range
- type: type of access used for that region:
    0 - nGnRE
    1 - nGnRnE

Example:

/ {
	io-ranges {
		#address-cells = <0x2>;
		#size-cells = <0x2>;
		ranges;

		on_chip_io@200000000 {
			reg = <0x2 0x00000000 0x2 0x00000000>;
			type = <1>;
		};

		/* ... */
	};
};
